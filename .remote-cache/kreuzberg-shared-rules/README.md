# AI-Rulez

Comprehensive AI-powered development governance and configuration for polyglot Rust-based projects with multi-language bindings. This shared module provides AI agents, development rules, skills, and profiles to accelerate polyglot development workflows across Rust, Python, TypeScript, Ruby, PHP, Java, Go, C#, Elixir, and WebAssembly.

## Overview

AI-Rulez is a reusable configuration module designed for projects that need consistent, AI-assisted development practices across multiple languages. It defines:

- **AI Agents** - Specialized roles for architecture, core development, language binding engineering, documentation, and QA
- **Development Rules** - Language-specific standards, patterns, and quality gates
- **Skills** - Reusable AI capabilities for code generation, testing, documentation, and domain-specific tasks
- **Profiles** - Pre-configured model routing and preset combinations for different development scenarios
- **Domains** - Logical groupings of agents, rules, and skills by functional area

This is a **shared module** meant to be included in other projects via git includes, not a standalone application.

## Quick Start

## Configuration Reference

### Model Routing Strategy

The default configuration routes different task types to optimal models:

| Task Type | Model | Roles | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Architecture | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | polyglot-architect, release-coordinator | Complex polyglot system design |
| Implementation | Claude Haiku 4.5 | binding-engineer-\*, rust-core-engineer | Fast, accurate code generation |
| Code Review | Claude Haiku 4.5 | code-reviewer, quality-assurance | Efficient review and validation |
| Documentation | Claude Haiku 4.5 | documentation-engineer, example-generator | Clear, concise documentation |

### Available Models

**Claude:**

- `claude-opus-4-5` - Complex reasoning for primary architecture
- `claude-sonnet-4-5` - Architecture and system design decisions
- `claude-haiku-4-5` - Fast implementation and code generation

**Gemini:**

- `gemini-2.0-flash` - Supplementary implementation tasks

**OpenAI Codex:**

- `code-davinci-003` - Legacy code completion and generation

### Quality Gates

All projects using this module must meet these quality standards:

- **Rust Coverage Minimum:** 95% code coverage
- **Binding Coverage Minimum:** 80% code coverage (language-specific constraints)
- **Test Types:** Unit, integration, documentation, and end-to-end tests
- **Language Parity:** All supported languages must have feature parity
- **Documentation:** All public APIs must be documented

### Version Synchronization

This module uses a monorepo versioning strategy:

- **Source of Truth:** `Cargo.toml`
- **Sync Targets:** pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, composer.json, pom.xml, go.mod, .csproj, mix.exs

Version changes in Cargo.toml automatically propagate to all language-specific package manifests.

## Using Profiles

Select a profile based on your project's primary language and scope:

### For Full Polyglot Projects

Use `full-polyglot` profile:

```yaml
# config.yaml in your project
extends:
  - path: .ai-rulez
    profile: full-polyglot
```

This activates all domains and agents for comprehensive polyglot development.

### For Rust-First Projects

Use `rust-first` profile:

```yaml
extends:
  - path: .ai-rulez
    profile: rust-first
```

Focuses on Rust core development with Sonnet for architecture decisions.

### For Lightweight/Rapid Iteration

Use `lightweight` profile:

```yaml
extends:
  - path: .ai-rulez
    profile: lightweight
```

Uses Haiku for all tasks, optimizing for speed and cost. Supports Rust, Python, and TypeScript.

## Extension Points

Projects using this module can extend it with custom configurations:

### Custom Agents

Define project-specific agents in `.ai-rulez/custom-agents.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  my-custom-agent:
    name: "My Custom Agent"
    description: "Project-specific AI role"
    model: "claude-haiku-4-5"
```

### Custom Rules

Add project-specific rules in `.ai-rulez/custom-rules.yaml`:

```yaml
rules:
  my-project-specific-rule:
    description: "Custom development standard"
```

### Custom Skills

Create `.ai-rulez/custom-skills/` directory for project-specific AI capabilities.

### Project Profiles

Define tailored profiles in `.ai-rulez/project-profiles.yaml`:

```yaml
profiles:
  my-project-profile:
    presets: [claude]
    languages: [rust, python]
    agents:
      - rust-core-engineer
      - python-bindings-engineer
```

## Common Workflows

### Initialize a New Polyglot Project

1. Include this module in your project configuration
1. Select the `full-polyglot` profile
1. Use the `polyglot-architect` agent for initial architecture decisions
1. Invoke language-specific binding engineers for each language target

### Code Review Across Languages

Use the `code-reviewer` agent with the full-polyglot profile to review code in any supported language. The agent applies language-specific rules and quality standards.

### Generate Documentation

Use the `docs-writer` or `api-doc-writer` agents to generate user guides and API documentation respectively. The configuration ensures documentation covers all supported languages with code examples.

### Create Language-Parity Tutorials

Use the `tutorial-writer` agent to generate tutorials that cover all supported languages. The agent ensures equivalent examples and explanations across languages.

### Manage Multi-Language Releases

Use the `release-versioning-coordinator` agent to:

1. Update version in Cargo.toml (source of truth)
1. Automatically sync versions to all language-specific manifests
1. Generate release notes covering all language bindings
1. Coordinate release across all platforms

## MCP Server Integrations

This module is configured with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced capabilities:

### GitHub Integration

Enable PR reviews, issue tracking, and release management through the `code-reviewer` agent.

**Setup:**

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

### Filesystem Access

Provide AI agents with code reading and analysis capabilities for architecture exploration and binding verification.

### Cargo Registry Integration

Enable dependency auditing and security scanning for Rust dependencies.

### Web Search

Support for researching FFI patterns, language binding best practices, and Rust ecosystem standards.

The configuration files use JSON schemas for IDE validation:

- Config schema: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez/main/schema/ai-rules-v3.schema.json`
- MCP schema: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez/main/schema/ai-rules-v3-mcp.schema.json`

## Best Practices

### Maintain Feature Parity

Ensure all supported languages have equivalent APIs and behavior. Use the `polyglot-architect` agent to design FFI boundaries that work well across all target languages.

### Respect Rust as Source of Truth

All core functionality lives in Rust. Language bindings are thin wrappers that expose language-idiomatic APIs. New features are implemented in Rust first, then exposed through bindings.

### Run Quality Gates

Before releases, verify:

- Rust code meets 95% coverage
- Binding code meets 80% coverage
- All test types pass (unit, integration, doc, e2e)
- All public APIs are documented
- All supported languages have feature parity

### Use Model Routing Strategically

Use Sonnet for complex architecture decisions and Haiku for implementation. This balance optimizes for quality and cost.

### Version Synchronization

When updating versions:

1. Update `Cargo.toml` (source of truth)
1. Verify all sync targets are updated
1. Use the `release-versioning-coordinator` agent to coordinate releases across languages

## Contributing

To extend or customize AI-Rulez for your project:
